If this occurs, it means that the node version in vagrant is not active anymore, you need to install an active one. 

Input 'nvm install 14.17.5' if your vagrant machine has not installed this version of node.js, or run 'nvm use 14.17.5' if it is already installed. Or I think you have install any version that is current active, check https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/
